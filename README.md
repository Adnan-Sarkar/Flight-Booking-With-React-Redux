This is a Flight Booking Application built with React-Redux that allows users to book flights. The application lets users:

- Enter their destination from, destination to, journey date, guests, and class, and save this data in the Redux store.

- Display the saved data in a table.

- Disable the book button if maximum 3 data have been added to the table, providing a validation that ensures only a maximum of 3 rows can be added.

- Delete a row from the table, which also deletes the corresponding data from the Redux store.
